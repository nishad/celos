<div align="justify"> Taking into consideration of the importance of the new and emerging subject of Photonics, Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) took steps to conduct an integrated Master&rsquo;s Programme in Photonics. The five year integrated MSc degree course in Photonics is being offered by the Centre of Excellence in Lasers and Optoelectronics Sciences (CELOS) which has been  established in this university through a special grant intended for this purpose from UGC. Five year integrated MSc in Photonics is an inter-disciplinary course as the activities under the CELOS have been jointly proposed by the    International School of Photonics (ISP),  Department of Physics and Department of Electronics of  CUSAT. <br /><br />Photoncs is a hi-tech subject that has evolved as a result of the fusion of optical technology with electronics. Its deep impact  in areas like communication, computing and control as well as in fields like medicine, industry, defense and entertainment has made Photonics as an independent subject on its own right.<br /><br />The present  MSc course has been designed in such a way that it includes the essential subjects like physics, mathematics, electronics, appplied optics, quantum optics, instrumentation and computer science which makes this a virtually new discipline.<br /><b><br /></b>
<div align="center"><b><img width="370" height="175" src="picture/upload/Image/academics/academics.html" alt="Academics" class="picture" /></b><br /></div>
<b><br />Scope of The Course</b> Recent advances in Photonics technology for imaging, health care and consumer electronics have contributed unprecedented progress in every sphere of human activities. Photonics based companies and R&amp;D institutions are growing day by day and these need people trained in Photonics and allied areas.</div>
