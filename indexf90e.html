the University of Gent - Belgium&nbsp;<br />
the University of Sheffield - United Kingdom<br />
the Warsaw University of Technology - Poland<br />
the University of St. Andrews-&nbsp;United Kingdom<br />
the IFCO Barcelone - Spain&nbsp;<br />
the&nbsp;Macquarie University - Australia<br />
the University od Basel -&nbsp;Switzerland&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Three students have got placements at&nbsp;Wipro Tehnologies&nbsp;in India<br />
<br />
The industrial placement has also been good with a student getting placed at SAMEER (Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering and Research), Mumbai and 3 students getting offshore placements in Sweden on a project by NeST Photonics.</div>

<br />
The aim of the Workshop is to introduce the exciting area of emerging technology namely Nanophotonics. Experts will discuss topics like interactions and materials related to nanophotonics, photonic crystals, biophotonics and photonic circuits. Nanophotonics deals with interactions between light and matter at a scale shorter than the wavelength of light itself. These nanoparticles are already being used for various applications of nanophotonics such as UV absorbers in sunscreen lotions. Metallic nanoparticles exhibit unique optical response and enhanced electromagnetic field and a new area called &quot;plasmonics&rdquo; has been introduced. There are nanoparticles which upconvert two absorbed IR photons into a photon in the visible UV range. Another important area is photonic crystal that represents a periodic dielectric structure with a repeat unit of the order of wavelength of light. Nanoscale photoprocesses can be used for nanolithography to fabricate nanostructures. These nanostructures can be used to form nanoscale sensors and actuators. A nanoscale optical memory is another area of exciting concept of nanofabrication.&nbsp;For further details visit: <br />

In view of the growing importance of Photonics in  diverse areas like communication, computing, medicine and entertainment., International School of Photonics (ISP) and Centre of Excellence in Lasers and Optoelectronics Sciences (CELOS) of CUSAT in collaboration with City University, London organized an Indo- UK workshop on Fibre Optics, Photonics and &nbsp;Bio-Instrumentstion during September 2-5. The main objective of this Workshop was to give an introduction to various topics in Fibre Optics to motivated students, researchers and teachers who want to enter in this area of Photonics.</div>
<h4>Optics Fair 2010</h4>

&ldquo;Tsunami&rdquo; a Spectra Physics make Ti:Sapphire pico/subpicosecond laser system was officially inaugurated at the Centre of Excellence in Laser and Optoelectronic Sciences (CELOS) in the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) by the Vice-Chancellor P.K. Abdul Azis on 8th August, 2006 making CUSAT the second university in the country to acquire such a system.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tsunami&quot; is pumped by 5W &ldquo;Millenium&rdquo; diode pumped solid state laser. The output from the &quot;Tsunami&quot; seed laser is further amplified by &quot;Spitfire&quot; a chirped pulse amplifer which is pumped by &quot;Empower&quot; a 30W Q-switched DPSS Nd:YLF laser. The final amplified ultrashort pulses have 70 femtosecond pulse duration and an energy of ~ 2.5mJ per pulse at 1KHz repitition rate.<br />
<br />
When focussed, this laser beam is capable of producing Terrawatt of pure light power at the focal spot of the beam. Atoms and molecules in the focal spot virtually explode under this intense laser field and they undergo explosive ionisation giving rise to many interesting physical and chemical phenomena.<br />
<br />
The new system is one of the most advanced and powerful lasers available in the world. It was imported from the U.S. at a cost of Rs.15 million.<br />
<br />
With this CELOS has become a &quot;National Facility&quot; centered around a pico/subpicosecond laser system as the major equipment, where scientists and researchers from other teaching/research institutions across the country can make their long and short term visits to carry out their respective research programmes using the ultra short laser pulses.</div>
