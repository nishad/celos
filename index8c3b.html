<h3><img src="content/gt/d9c5a25846a2710ba05fca920c4d9354.png" alt="LASER TECHNOLOGY" title="LASER TECHNOLOGY" width="265" height="33" border="0" /></h3>
<div align="justify">At the time of their invention in 1960, lasers were called         &quot;a solution looking for a problem&quot;. Since then, they have         become ubiquitous, finding utility in thousands of highly         varied applications in every section of modern society,         including consumer electronics, information technology,         science, medicine, industry, law enforcement and the         military.<br />
<br />
A laser (from the acronym Light Amplification by Stimulated         Emission of Radiation) is an optical source that emits         photons in a coherent beam. The back-formed verb to lase         means &quot;to produce laser light&quot; or possibly &quot;to apply laser         light to&quot;.<br />
<br />
<img width="300" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="238" border="1" align="right" alt="Femto Second Ti-Sapphire Laser &quot;Tsunami&quot; " src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/tsunami.jpg" />Laser              light is typically near-monochromatic, i.e.,              consisting of a single wavelength or color, and              emitted in a narrow beam. This is in contrast to              common light sources, such as the incandescent light              bulb, which emit incoherent photons in almost all              directions, usually over a wide spectrum of              wavelengths.<br />
<br />
Laser action is explained by the theories of quantum         mechanics and thermodynamics. Many materials have been         found to have the required characteristics to form the         laser gain medium needed to power a laser, and these have         led to the invention of many types of lasers with different         characteristics suitable for different applications.A laser         is composed of an active laser medium, or gain medium, and         a resonant optical cavity.<br />
<br />
The gain medium transfers external energy into the laser         beam. It is a material of controlled purity, size and         shape, which amplifies the beam by the quantum mechanical         process of stimulated emission, discovered by Albert         Einstein while researching the photoelectric effect. The         gain medium is energized, or pumped, by an external energy         source. Examples of pump sources include electricity and         light, for example from a flash lamp o r from another         laser. The pump energy is absorbed by the laser medium,         putting some of its particles into high-energy, or excited,         quantum states. When the number of particles in one excited         state exceeds the number of particles in some lower-energy         state, population inversion is achieved. In this condition,         an optical beam passing through the medium produces more         stimulated emission than the stimulated absorption so the         beam is amplified. An excited laser medium can also         function as an optical amplifier.<br />
<br />
<img width="300" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="296" border="1" align="left" alt="He-Ne Laser" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/HeNeLaser.jpg" />The              light generated by stimulated emission is very similar              to the input signal in terms of wavelength, phase, and              polarization. This gives laser light its              characteristic coherence, and allows it to maintain              the uniform polarization and monochromaticity              established by the optical cavity design.<br />
<br />
The optical cavity, an example of a type of cavity         resonator, contains a coherent beam of light between         reflective surfaces so that each photon passes through the         gain medium multiple times before being emitted from the         output aperture or lost to diffraction or absorption. As         light circulates through the cavity, passing through the         gain medium, if the gain (amplification) in the medium is         stronger than the resonator losses, the power of the         circulating light can rise exponentially. However, each         stimulated emission event returns a particle from its         excited state to the ground state, reducing the capacity of         the gain medium for further amplification. When this effect         becomes strong, the gain is said to be saturated. The         balance of pump power against gain saturation and cavity         losses produces an equilibrium value of the intracavity         laser power which determines the operating point of the         laser. If the pump power is chosen too small, the gain is         not sufficient to overcome the resonator losses, and the         laser will emit only very small light powers. The min imum         pump power required to begin laser action is called the         lasing threshold. Note that the gain medium will amplify         any photons passing through it, regardless of direction,         however it is only the ones that happen to be aligned with         the cavity that manage to make multiple passes through the         medium and so have significant amplification.<br />
<br />
The beam in the cavity and the output beam of the laser, if         they occur in free space rather than waveguides (as in an         optical fiber laser), are often Gaussian beams. If the beam         is not a pure Gaussian shape, the transverse modes of the         beam may be analyzed as a superposition of Hermite-Gaussian         or Laguerre-Gaussian beams. The beam may be highly         collimated, that is, having a very small divergence, but a         perfectly collimated beam cannot be created, due to the         effect of diffraction. Nonetheless, a laser beam will         spread much less than a beam of incoherent light. The         distance over which the beam remains collimated increases         with the square of the beam diameter, and the angle at         which the beam eventually diverges varies inversely with         the diameter. Thus, a beam generated by a small laboratory         laser such as a helium-neon (HeNe) laser spreads to         approximately 1.6 kilometres (1 mile) in diameter if shone         from the Earth's surface to the Moon. By comparison, the         output of a typical semiconductor laser, due to its small         diameter, diverges almost immediately on exiting the         aperture, at an angle that may be as high as 50&deg;.         However, such a divergent beam can be transformed into a         collimated beam by means of a lens. In contrast, the light         from non-laser light sources cannot be collimated by optics         as well or much.The output of a laser may be a continuous,         constant-amplitude output (known as CW or continuous wave),         or pulsed, by using the techniques of Q-switching,         modelocking, or gain-switching. In pulsed operation, much         higher peak powers can be achieved.<br />
<br />
<img width="300" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="225" border="1" align="right" alt="Laser in Operation" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/laser.jpg" />Some              types of lasers, such as dye lasers and vibronic              solid-state lasers can produce light over a broad              range of wavelengths; this property makes them              suitable for the generation of extremely short pulses              of light, on the order of a femtosecond              (10<sup>-15</sup> s).<br />
<br />
Though the laser phenomenon was discovered with the help of         quantum physics, it is not essentially more quantum         mechanical than are other sources of light. In fact the         operation of a free electron laser can be explained without         reference to quantum mechanics.<br />
<br />
It should be understood that the word light in the acronym         Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation is         typically used in the expansive sense, as photons of any         energy; it is not limited to photons in the visible         spectrum. Hence there are X-ray lasers, infrared lasers,         ultraviolet lasers, etc. Because the microwave equivalent         of the laser, the maser, was developed first, devices that         emit microwave and radio frequencies are usually called         masers. In early literature, particularly from researchers         at Bell Telephone Laboratories, the laser was often called         the optical maser. This usage has since become uncommon,         and as of 1998 even Bell Labs uses the term laser.<br />
<br />
The benefits of lasers in various applications stems from         their properties such as coherency, high monochromaticity,         and capability for reaching extremely high powers. For         instance, a highly coherent laser beam can be focused down         to its diffraction limit, which at visible wavelengths         corresponds to only a few hundred nanometers. This property         allows a laser to record gigabytes of information in the         microscopic pits of a DVD. It also allows a laser of modest         power to be focused to very high intensities and used for         cutting, burning or even vaporizing materials. For example,         a frequency doubled neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet         (Nd:YAG) laser emitting 532 nanometer (green) light at 10         watts output power is theoretically capable of achieving a         focused in tensity of megawatts per square centimeter. In         reality however, perfect focusing of a beam to its         diffraction limit is somewhat difficult.<br />
<br />
Some of the basic applications of lasers are:<br />
<br />
<b>Communication</b><br />
In consumer electronics, telecommunications, and data         communications, lasers are used as the transmitters in         optical communications over optical fiber and free space.         They are used to store and retrieve data from compact discs         and DVDs, as well as magneto-optical discs. Laser lighting         displays (pictured) accompany many music concerts.<br />
<br />
<b><img width="300" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="225" border="1" align="left" alt="Laser in Use" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/laserblue.jpg" />Science</b><br />
In science, lasers are employed in a wide variety of         interferometric techniques, and for Raman spectroscopy and         laser induced breakdown spectroscopy. Other uses include         atmospheric remote sensing, and investigation of nonlinear         optics phenomena. Holographic techniques employing lasers         also contribute to a number of measurement techniques.         Laser (LIDAR) technology has application in geology,         seismology, remote sensing and atmospheric physics. In         astronomy, lasers have been used to create artificial laser         guide stars, used as reference objects for adaptive optics         telescopes.<br />
<br />
<b>Medicine</b><br />
In medicine, the laser scalpel is used for laser vision         correction and other surgical techniques. Lasers are also         used for dermatological procedures including removal of         tattoos, birthmarks, and hair; laser types used in         dermatology include ruby (694 nm), alexandrite (755 nm),         pulsed diode array (810 nm), Nd:YAG (1064 nm), Ho:YAG (2090         nm), and Er:YAG (2940 nm). Lasers are also used in         photobiomodulation (laser therapy) and in acupuncture. They         are also now used in dentistry for caries removal,         endodontic/periodontic procedures, as well as tooth         whitening and oral surgery procedures.<br />
<br />
<b>Industry</b><br />
In industry, laser cutting is used to cut metals and othe r         materials. Laser line levels are used in surveying and         construction. Lasers are also used for guidance for         aircraft. Lasers are used in certain types of thermonuclear         fusion reactors. Lasers are also used extensively in both         consumer and industrial imaging equipment. The name laser         printer speaks for itself but both gas and diode lasers         play a key role in manufacturing high resolution printing         plates and in image scanning equipment.<br />
<br />
<b>Road safety</b><br />
In law enforcement the most widely known use of lasers is         for lidar, to detect the speed of vehicles.<br />
<br />
<b>Military</b><br />
Military uses of lasers include use as target designators         for other weapons; their use as directed-energy weapons is         currently under research. Laser weapon systems under         development include the airborne laser, the advanced         tactical laser, the Tactical High Energy Laser, the High         Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System, and the MIRACL, or         Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser.<b><br />
