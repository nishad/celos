When the feeling triggered by cinema lasts beyond         momentarily experience, then it is touching your life.         Photonium is the fraternity of those young minds, who         cherish and celebrate this life touching spirit of         cinema.<br />
<br />
</span></font><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: normal;"><span class="bodybold"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.photonics.cusat.edu/photonium/index.htm">Photonium</a> was started in late 2005            by a group of seven students (Adil Masood, Sibilathullah            AM,&nbsp; Praveen CA, Anish Krishnan            MA,&nbsp;Sreeparvathi Warrier,&nbsp;Gopika Ramanandan            and Saurabh Raj ) of CELOS to provide a platform in the            campus where the true patrons of this art can explore as            well as manifest the enigma of cinema. The aim of            Photonium is to promote and popularize the cinema at its            best inside the campus. To achieve this goal, Photonium            is involved in two kind of activities:<br />
<br />
</span></font> &bull; <font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: normal;"><span class="bodybold">To encourage viewing and appreciation of              critical cinema, Photonium organizes screening of              films related to different aspects of life at regular              basis for free. The club also encourages discussions              and exchange of views related to the cinema among its              members and viewers.<br />
<br />
</span></font> &bull; <font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: normal;"><span class="bodybold">To encourage the creativity and innovation              t owards the art of cinema, Photonium is involved in              campus film production where it produces films and              documentaries by harnessing the talent and skills of              students only. Photonium has already produced two              documentaries in the very short span of about six              months.<br />
<br />
<b>Einstein's Universe<br />
<br />
</b></span></font><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: normal;"><span class="bodybold"><img width="150" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="215" align="left" alt="Cover - Einstein's Universe" src="picture/upload/image/activities/eu.jpg" /></span></font><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: normal;"><span class="bodybold">&ldquo;Things should be made as simple as              possible, but not any simpler&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;              &ndash; Albert Einstein<br />
</span></font><br />
<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: normal;"><span class="bodybold">Simple is beautiful. And no one can frame              this essence in any better words than the person who              conceived the most beautiful theory of nature. History              witnesses, but only rarely, the life of such epoch              making individuals.<br />
Realization of a documentary on this millennium man was         not just about presenting the facts, but it was about         conveying the essence of the spirit immortalized by Albert         Einstein.<br />
The spirit of originality.<br />
The spirit of existence<br />
The spirit of persistence<br />
The spirit of simplicity<br />
&lsquo;Einstein&rsquo;s Universe&rsquo; is an attempt by         those who endured this spirit while indulging in         &lsquo;Einstein&rsquo;s Universe&rsquo;, to tribute and         celebrate the spirit of &lsquo;Einstein&rsquo;.<br />
<br />
Its the very first production of Photonium. In fact, it         was during the realization of Einstein's Universe that the         idea of evolving an organized platform in the form of         Photonium cropped up. 'Einstein's Universe' is unique in         many sense as it was made using only archive videos, clips         , images, animations and sound tracks. Still it succeeded         in conveying its true message in the simplest form. Since         then, it has been screened successfully at many academic         institutes like IIT Delhi, IIT Madras, VIT Vellore etc as         well as in many film festivals. Recently there was a         special screening of Einstein's Universe alongwith a         presentation on its making at&nbsp;SPIE Annual Meeting at         San Diego, USA during 13&ndash;17 August, 2006.<br />

<b>A Sentient Sequel<br />
</b><br />
<img width="150" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="216" align="left" alt="" src="picture/upload/image/activities/ss.jpg" />This is              the story of a premier Science and Technology              University of India which ,while striving to live up              to its expectations of the society, has made quantum              leaps in its academic pursuits and has spread its              wings far and wide to encompass new and emerging              frontiers across the academic horizon. It was the              second venture of Photonium. After the success of              'Einstein's Universe', Photonium was entrusted to              produce a short documentary on Cochin University of              Science and Technology (CUSAT). Produced within a              short notice, Photonium succeeded in performing all              the technical works of shooting, editing, dubbing,              voice &amp; music mixing etc within a week.<br />
<br />
The documentary was inaugurated by the Hon. Education         Minister of Kerala, Mr. E.T. Mohammed Basheer, at         International Educational Meet, Kochi, in February '06 and         since then, it has been accepted as the official         documentary of CUSAT.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Project Picasso<br />
</b><br />
The upcoming production of Photonium has been christened as         Project Picasso.&nbsp; It is a docu-drama based on 'Mr.         Tompkins in Wonderland' by George Gamow.<br />
