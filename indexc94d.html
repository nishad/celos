<h3><img src="content/gt/7d18167f4ff290dc63f5cc4c4891e2d1.png" alt="MICROWAVE PHOTONICS" title="MICROWAVE PHOTONICS" width="329" height="33" border="0" /></h3>
<div align="justify">Recently, research in this area has blossomed with studies looking at many issues including basic optical-microwave interaction (e.g., radio frequency signal generation), photonics devices operating at microwave frequencies, photonic control of microwave devices, high frequency transmission links, and the use of photonics to implement various functions in microwave systems. Novel applications where that have been investigated include spectrum analysis, frequency conversion, high performance oscillators, and analogue-to-digital conversion. Continued progress in photonic components and technology sustains great interest in this field and expanding acceptance of photonics for microwave systems. With these new applications there are increasing requirements for high performance devices for microwave and mm-wave systems.<br />
<br />
The many advantages of microwave fibre-optic communication links over conventional coaxial or waveguide links are well known. They include reduced size, weight and cost, low and constant attenuation over the entire modulation frequency range, imperviousness to electromagnetic interference, extremely wide bandwidth, low dispersion, and high information transfer capacity. These advantages mean that they are currently viable contenders for a number of applications of commercial importance including:<br />
<br />
<b><a name="pcn"></a>Personal Communications Networks</b><br />
where microcells in a wide area are connected by optical fibres and use radio extension links to the home allowing increased bandwidth (and the possibility of mobile broadband systems) and high spectrum reuse efficiency without the significant expense of installing fibre to the home.<br />
<br />
<b>Millimetre-wave radio LANs</b><br />
with the radio nodes (possibly picocells) are fed by optical fibre with similar advantages to the above.<br />
<br />
<b>Antenna Remoting</b><br />
at satellite earth stations where optical fibre transmission allows the concentration of the remote equipment at a central location and the quick re-routing of traffic to different antennas via centralised switching.<br />
<b><br />
Broadband video distribution networks</b><br />
using subcarrier multiplexing and exploiting the advantages of the broad bandwidth and low loss of optical fibre<br />
<b><br />
Signal distribution for phased array antennas</b><br />
where the use of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC) has reduced the cost of active elements so that the main cost and weight is in the signal distribution.<br />
<br />
The advantages have long been recognised, however, except in some high-bandwidth point-to-point military links, their practical exploitation has been limited due to the poor microwave performance of practical microwave optical sources. Many of these limitations have now been overcome, with, for example, the use of the optical phase-locked loop, and so we are therefore likely to see increased use of radio-on-fibre systems, particularly at higher frequencies in the future. This area of research is becoming, if anything, more important than ever. Many companies looking towards developing 27GHz broadband cellular network technologies in the near term and there is an increased interest in the possibilities of using the 60 GHz and 70GHz bands, with their excellent frequency reuse, for broadband pico-cellular operations.</div>
