<h3><img src="content/gt/e5018c74d104c32ad1be5adbada58c5a.png" alt="OPTOELECTRONIC DEVICES" title="OPTOELECTRONIC DEVICES" width="345" height="33" border="0" /></h3>
<div align="justify">OPTOELECTRONIC devices either produce light or use light in their operation. The first of these, the light-emitting diode (LED), was developed to replace the fragile, short-life incandescent light bulbs used to indicate on/off conditions on panels. A LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE is a diode which, when forward biased, produces visible light. The light may be red, green, or amber, depending upon the material used to make the diode.<br />
<br />
<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="128" border="1" align="left" alt="LED" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/led.gif" />Figure on left shows an LED and its schematic symbol. The LED is designated by a standard diode symbol with two arrows pointing away from the cathode. The arrows indicate light leaving the diode. The circuit symbols for all optoelectronic devices have arrows pointing either toward them, if they use light, or away from them, if they produce light. The LED operating voltage is small, about 1.6 volts forward bias and generally about 10 milliamperes. The life expectancy of the LED is very long, over 100,000 hours of operation. LEDs are used widely as &quot;power on&quot; indicators of current and as displays for pocket calculators, digital voltmeters, frequency counters, etc. <br />
<br />
Another special optoelectronic device in common use today is the photodiode. Unlike the LED, which produces light, the photodiode uses light to accomplish special circuit functions. Basically, the PHOTODIODE is a light-controlled variable resistor. In total darkness, it has a relatively high resistance and therefore conducts little current. However, when the PN junction is exposed to an external light source, internal resistance decreases and current flow increases. The photodiode is operated with reverse-bias and conducts current in direct proportion to the intensity of the light source.<br />
<br />
<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="116" border="1" align="left" alt="Photodiode" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/photodiode.GIF" />Figure on left shows a photodiode with its schematic symbol. The arrows pointing toward the symbol indicate that light is required for operation of the device. A light source is aimed at the photodiode through a transparent &quot;window&quot; placed over the semiconductor chip. Switching the light source on or off changes the conduction level of the photodiode. Varying the light intensity controls the amount of conduction. Because photodiodes respond quickly to changes in light intensity, they are extremely useful in digital applications such as computer card readers, paper tape readers, and photographic light meters. They are also used in some types of optical scanning equipment.<br />
<br />
<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="120" border="1" align="right" alt="Phototransistor" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/phototransistor.gif" />A second optoelectronic device that conducts current when exposed to light is the PHOTOTRANSISTOR. A phototransistor, however, is much more sensitive to light and produces more output current for a given light intensity that does a photodiode. Figure on right shows one type of phototransistor, which is made by placing a photodiode in the base circuit of an NPN transistor. Light fa<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="214" border="1" align="right" alt="2-terminal and 3-terminal phototransistors" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/phototransistors.gif" />lling on the photodiode changes the base current of the transistor, causing the collector current to be amplified. Phototransistors may also be of the PNP type, with the photodiode placed in the base-collector circuit.<br />
<br />
Figure on right illustrates the schematic symbols for the various types of phototransistors. Phototransistors may be of the two-terminal type, in which the light intensity on the photodiode alone determines the amount of conduction. They may also be of the three-terminal type, which have an added base lead that allows an electrical bias to be applied to the base. The bias allows an optimum transistor conduction level, and thus compensates for ambient (normal room) light intensity.<br />
<br />
<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="95" border="1" align="left" alt="Photocell" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/photocell.gif" />An older device that uses light in a way similar to the photodiode is the photoconductive cell, or PHOTOCELL, shown with its schematic symbol in the figure on left. Like the photodiode, the photocell is a light-controlled variable resistor. However, a typical light-to-dark resistance ratio for a photocell is 1:1000. This means that its resistance could range from 1000 ohms in the light to 1000 kilohms in the dark, or from 2000 ohms in the light to 2000 kilohms in the dark, and so forth. Of course, other ratios are also available. Photocells are used in various types of control and timing circuits as, for example, the automatic street light controllers in most cities.<br />
<br />
<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="104" border="1" align="right" alt="Solar Cell" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/solar_cell.gif" />The photovoltaic cell, or solar cell, is a device which converts light energy into electrical energy. An example of a solar cell and its schematic symbol are shown in figure on right. The symbol is similar to that of a battery. The device itself acts much like a battery when exposed to light and produces about .45 volt across its terminals, with current capacity determined by its size. As with batteries, solar cells may be connected in series or parallel to produce higher voltages and currents. The device is finding widespread application in communications satellites and solar-powered homes.<br />
<br />
<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="153" border="1" align="left" alt="Dc blocking with a coupling capacitor" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/coupling_capacitor.gif" />When it is necessary to block the voltage between one electronic circuit and another, and transfer the signal at the same time, an amplifier coupling capacitor is often used as shown in figure on side. Although this method of coupling does block dc between the circuits, voltage isolation is not complete.<br />
<br />
A newer method, making use of optoelectronic devices to achieve electrical isolation, is the optical coupler, shown in<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="155" border="1" align="right" alt="Optical Coupler" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/optical_coupler.gif" /> the figure below. The coupler is composed of an LED and a photodiode contained in a light-conducting medium. As the polarity signs in figure show, the LED is forward biased, while the photodiode is reverse biased. When the input signal causes current through the LED to increase, the light produce by the LED increases. This increased light intensity causes current flow through the photodiode to increase. In this way, changes in input current produce proportional changes in the output, even though the two circuits are electrically isolated.<br />
<br />
The optical coupler is suitable for frequencies in the low megahertz range. The photodiode type shown above can handle only small currents; however, other types of couplers, combining phototransistors with the SCR, can be used where more output is required. Optical couplers are replacing transformers in low-voltage and low-current applications. Sensitive digital circuits can use the coupler to control large current and voltages with low-voltage logic levels.</div>
