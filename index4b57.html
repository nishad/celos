The centre will make all the necessary arrangements to make your visit to the campus a success. Those organizations who cannot come to the campus can opt for an on-line or off-campus placement session.<br /><br />All the interested organizations can visit the home page of <a href="spo.html" class="phpwcmsIntLink">Student Placement Office, CELOS</a> for further details.<br />&nbsp;<br /><img src="picture/icons/intlink.gif" border="0" alt="" /><a href="spo.html" class="phpwcmsIntLink">http://celos.cusat.ac.in/spo.phtml</a><br /><br /><br /></div>

The main objective of this Workshop was to give an introduction to various topics in Fibre Optics to motivated students, researchers and teachers who want to enter in this area of Photonics.<br /><br /><br /></div>

Abdul Azis on 8th August, 2006 making CUSAT the second university in the country to acquire such a system.<br /><br />&quot;Tsunami&quot; is pumped by 5W &ldquo;Millenium&rdquo; diode pumped solid state laser. The output from the &quot;Tsunami&quot; seed laser is further amplified by &quot;Spitfire&quot; a chirped pulse amplifer which is pumped by &quot;Empower&quot; a 30W Q-switched DPSS Nd:YLF laser. The final amplified ultrashort pulses have 70 femtosecond pulse duration and an energy of ~ 2.5mJ per pulse at 1KHz repitition rate.<br /><br />When focussed, this laser beam is capable of producing Terrawatt of pure light power at the focal spot of the beam. Atoms and molecules in the focal spot virtually explode under this intense laser field and they undergo explosive ionisation giving rise to many interesting physical and chemical phenomena.<br /><br />The new system is one of the most advanced and powerful lasers available in the world. It was imported from the U.S. at a cost of Rs.15 million.<br /><br />With this CELOS has become a &quot;National Facility&quot; centered around a pico/subpicosecond laser system as the major equipment, where scientists and researchers from other teaching/research institutions across the country can make their long and short term visits to carry out their respective research programmes using the ultra short laser pulses.<br /><br /><br /></div>

In view of this, the International School of Photonics in association with Centre of Excellence in lasers and Opto-electronic Sciences is organizing a 3-day Workshop (APW&ndash;2008) on &ldquo;Ultrafast processes and Applications&rdquo;. The main objective of APW&ndash; 2008 is to give an introduction to the above topic to motivated persons planning to work in these areas. The target group will be young researchers and teachers in the Universities, colleges and other research institutions.<br /><br />Tentative list of topics to be covered are ultrafast pulse generation, diagnostic and pulse characterization methods, ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy, high power laser systems and time resolved studies in the picosecond and sub-picosecond domain. One Session will be devoted to poster presentation by the participants. The Workshop will be inaugurated by Professor G P Agrawal, Institute of Optics, University of Rochester, USA and he will also be giving some lectures on non-linear fiber optics in ultrafast time scales on 26th February, 2008. There will be demonstrations of some experiments using the sub-picosecond laser system available in our laboratory.
