<h3><img src="content/gt/9d012489acad29e0ef18fb21dac64248.png" alt="COCHIN CITY" title="COCHIN CITY" width="172" height="33" border="0" /></h3>
<div align="justify"><img src="content/gt/45ea86174bd741f3131fca9124437d19.png" alt="Visiting Cochin" title="Visiting Cochin" width="117" height="27" border="0" /><br /><br />Cochin or Kochi, as it is called now is situated on the west coast of India in the beautiful greenish state of Kerala. Cochin has long been eulogised in tourist literature as the &lsquo;Queen of the Arabian Sea&rsquo;. This simple heckneyed phrase reflects the beauty and long-standing maritime importance. The city is basically a collection of islands and narrow peninsulas and can be mainly divided in to Ernakulam, Willington Island, Mattancherry and Fort Cochin, which spreads around 87sq.kms. Ernakulam is the business centre and forms the main land. It is separated from the Fort Cochin and Mattancherry by the river Periyar that flows down to the Arabian Sea. Cochin has the finest natural harbors in the world around which the city has grown. Being one of the important cities on the western coast, Cochin is well connected by road and rail to all important cities in India. The nearby international airport is linked with national and many international destinations.<br /><br /><br /><img src="content/gt/a17ac43ca54745aa1372e0b9873066ae.png" alt="History of the City" title="History of the City" width="140" height="27" border="0" /><br /><br />The history of Cochin dates back to hundreds of years. At the end of fourteenth century the &quot;Perumpadappu Family&quot;, the local king, shifted their capital to Cochin. This small town started to grow and developed in to a major trade point of spices after the formation of the natural port by a massive flood in 1340 AD when the river Periyar flooded over and washed away the then famous port at Cranganore. By the bigining of the sixteenth century the Portuguese arrived and Cochin began to gain importance. Long back the arrival of Europians, Cochin had good trade relations with China and Middle East. Also many Jews were settled in and around the city. By the end of 1653 the Dutch invasion started and they defeated the Portuguese. But by the end of seventeenth century the rulers of Mysore collapsed the Dutch power. The British took over Cochin after the forth Mysore war. In 1814 the construction of a modern port began and by 1936 Cochin became a major port. Post independence, in 1967, the Corporation Cochin was formed and the Queen of the Arabian, after shifting to so many hands, was finally at peace.<br /><br /><br /><img src="content/gt/6d27dcef3e6cecc4d7342d7791ef583a.png" alt="Attractions" title="Attractions" width="86" height="27" border="0" /><br /><br />From time immemorial Arabs, Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch and British seafarers followed the sea route to Cochin and left their impression on the town. This fact is tangibly evident in the city&rsquo;s well-known landmarks. The must see places include the Dutch palace built in 1555, Jewish synagogue built in 1568, St. Francis church by the Portuguese, Santa Cruz Basilica, Bolgatty palace, the man made Willington island and the 15th century Paallipuram fort. You can see rows of Chinese fishing nets at Fort Cochin water front. In and around the city there are three museums. You can also enjoy the traditional art form called &quot;Kathakali&quot; and  martial art &quot;Kalaripayattu&quot; in many cultural centres. Tourist information and city maps are available from the three tourist offices run by government agencies.<br /><br /><br /><img src="content/gt/b8ba63a6f5d6ff0cd970a8f8461a20a3.png" alt="Hotels" title="Hotels" width="52" height="27" border="0" /><br /><br />It is better to stay in Ernakulam than Cochin, as the range of accommodation is greater there. During December to January, there is a great rush for hotel rooms. You can find many delux and budget hotels. Yatri Nivas, Tourist lodges and hostels provide a convenient and cheap base.<br /><br /><br /><img src="content/gt/3e61b1618cbe8d72bc87250c8ae36a18.png" alt="Eat Outs" title="Eat Outs" width="69" height="27" border="0" /><br /><br />Cochin has an enormous range of restaurants, offering reasonably priced food and drinks. You can eat out quite cheaply in Cochin but if you have more expensive tastes, then there are number of well known restaurants. You can have the traditional Kerala dishes from most of the restaurants. Many of them also offers cuisines from different countries.<br /><br /><br /><img src="content/gt/8792358bf3cbf6bed9f0cdbbffadacb4.png" alt="Shopping" title="Shopping" width="75" height="27" border="0" /><br /><br />The Mahatma Gandhi (MG) road, branches off from the Banerji road cuts through what is today the city's main commercial district. A bustling shopping centre where you can buy all kind of goods. Many airline offices, hotels, restaurants, and movie theatres are along this road. The Marine Drive and the lively GCDA Commercial Complex along the water front features a variety of shopping malls. You can buy all kind of spices from Broad Way running parallel to the east of Shanmugham road or from Mattancherry. Antique shops can be find in Jews town. <br /><br /><br /><img src="content/gt/37c6225ff147391cdc2c2896a5d7ceba.png" alt="Climate" title="Climate" width="62" height="27" border="0" /><br /><br />	Being situated very close to the sea, Cochin has a moderate climate, with heavy rains during June to August due to the southwest monsoon.
