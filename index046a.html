<p style="text-align: justify; "></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">Currently I am IXth semester (Batch 5) student &nbsp;here at CELOS and would be passing out in May 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;My fields of interest include microfluidics; industrial photonics that very much include fields of MEMS , advanced sensors and sensor networks ; semiconductor nanostructures; materials for photovoltaics;nanophotonics devices; high bandwidth transmission; microscopy, Optoelectronics, Laser Physics, Optics, Electronics, Quantum Mechanics, Solid State Theory, Nuclei, Particlesand BeamsWell &nbsp;list does go on and on.!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>RESEARCH PROJECTS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">I was research project student at Quantum Information group (QUIN) of Physics department, Technical University of Denmark under Prof. Ulrik L. Andersen where I was au fait with latest &nbsp;path breaking research in field of plasmonics and quantum Information. I have acquainted myself with cutting edge technology and learned new techniques and invaluable skills of working at state of the art labs.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify; "><em><strong>Nanostructures for Quantum Information Processing</strong></em></div>
<div style="text-align: justify; "><em><strong>DTU Fysik, Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark (May-July 2010) Supervisor: Prof. Ulrik L. Andersen</strong></em></div>
<div style="text-align: justify; ">Realization of single photon sources for Quantum Information systems. Coupling nitrogen vacancy centres in diamonds to metallic waveguides are crucial for single photon sources in optical network Primarily my work was to make metallic waveguide structures in size of micrometer or more. Gold and silver waveguides were fabricated by performing focused ion beam milling on metallic nanoflakes. The coupling to diamonds was achieved by an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). Photon emission of NV centre coupled to metallic waveguide were taken. Primarily results obtained till now looks positive.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify; "></p>
<div style="text-align: justify; "><em><strong>Investigation of electron spin of nitrogen vacancy centres in diamonds</strong></em></div>
<div style="text-align: justify; "><em><strong>DTU Fysik, Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark (May-July 2010) Supervisor: Ulrik L. Andersen&nbsp;</strong></em></div>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">We sought to examine the spin transition between the triplet ground and excited states. Polarization selectivity rules can be tested by subjecting to microwave frequency (~2870MHz). My role was to design and fabricate microstrip coplanar waveguides tuned to microwave frequencies. The work involved simulation of design parameters and working on photolithography masks for waveguides and vacuum deposition apparatus for gold metallic layers. Next &nbsp;NV centres are placed in presence of TEM field, based on the orientation of magnetic field orientation various measurements regarding excitation and polarization are made.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">Apart &nbsp;from regular academic stuff, I am involved in quite a few invigorating &nbsp;research &nbsp;works here at our labs.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify; "><em><strong>Design, Implementation and commercialization of spectral surface plasmon resonance sensors for biomedical application. (Current)</strong></em></div>
<div style="text-align: justify; ">The idea is to make a portable and accurate sensor employing the principle of SPR(Surface Plasmon Resonance) . Presence of an analyte molecule will cause a shift SPR resonance of metallic nanoparticles. A fiber based SPR sensor is made by stripping the cladding and depositing PVA and nanoparticles coating. Next we palce place in micrometer width channel. Such a sensor enable to consume micrometer amount of analyte. Trials have been performed on dummy samples and next trials would be on biological samples.&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: justify; "></p>
<div style="text-align: justify; "><em><strong>Laser Ablation of Nobel metals nanoparticles and NLO characterization, (July 2009- January 2010)</strong></em></div>
<div style="text-align: justify; ">So far we have been successful in creating in silver and gold nanoparticles in organic aqua mediums using laser ablation (Nd:YAG at 1064nm &amp; 532nm). Also using Z scan we have found non linear absorption coefficienct and non linear refractive index. Next we seek to implement these samples and for plasmonics sensors</div>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: justify; "><em><strong>Diffusivity measurements by using photothermal method.</strong></em></div>
<div style="text-align: justify; ">Using a dual beam methods we have found thermal diffusivity of Nano-composites (silver nanoparticles in Rhodaminne6G &nbsp;and PPV dyes ). Photo-thermal being non destructive method is found to be apt for low &nbsp;diffusivuty &nbsp;measurements. Also fluorescence related related aspect has been studied.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; ">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; "><em><strong>Realization of optical logic gates and optical bistable functions in saturable absorbers under pulsed and continuous wave excitations</strong></em></div>
<div style="text-align: justify; ">This project includes &nbsp;my VIth semester mini project. We have successfully formed the NOT and NAND gate by thermal lens technique. We have covered the various aspects of our experimental setup and results. Experiments were carried out for different samples like PPV and nanocomposite of PPV and Silver. Optical bistability and its occurrence has been demonstrated through experiments using pulsed and CW lasers. Under various values of the peak on axis intensity at focus, we were able to observe different optical functions like optical switching, optical limiting and optical memory under pulsed excitation. Preliminary results in CW regime also indicated optical switching. We had attributed these to optical bistability induced by nonlinear absorptionand nonlinear refraction.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">I have tried to put my knowledge and skills for a little better use .</p>
<div style="text-align: justify; "><em><strong>Epidural space measurements using fiber optic probe for anesthetic drug delivery (May 2009)</strong></em></div>
<div style="text-align: justify; ">I spent my summer of 2009 at Stanford India biodesign &nbsp;program at AIIMS. New Delhi where I applied my know in areas of biophotonics and biomedical sciences. My field of investigation was epidural space measurements, in essence we have started by positioning fiber within catheter and trials were performed nonliving solid samples and standardization of results.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; ">Development of tunable Pulse Plethysmography for diabetic foot detection. &nbsp;(May-June2009)</div>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">During the same summer I was part of Centre for Biomedical Engineering(CBME) at IIT Delhi for another aspect biomedical optics. We aimed to make a low cost tunable PPG which can be put to use for measuring various parameter apart from blood measurements. Instead of fixed frequency source,we have tunnable source covering the IR NIR range. Currently protoype is in design stage.</p>
