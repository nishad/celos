<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I joined CELOS, Cochin University of Science and Technology in the year 2005 to participate in five year integrated programme in photonics offered by the&nbsp;centre. Presently, I am in ninth semester of the M.Sc course. Being born in rural area of Samastipur, I did my primary and secondary education at boarding &nbsp;school; a foresight from my parents to help me achieve high academic standards towards a rewarding career.&nbsp;I am hard working and very determined. I enjoy working with a team and am able to work unsupervised. I am reliable, I strive to always keep a positive&nbsp;attitude and have the ability to learn quickly. I am adaptable and can work with people from diverse cultures/backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">My research interests are centred on optoelectronics, lasers, nano-photonics, and light matter interaction specifically non-linear optics. I have worked for&nbsp;a semester as well as for two summer internships in projects involving nanoparticles synthesis &amp; characterization, holographic imaging and non-volatile memory devices at reputed labs in the country. After I graduate, I plan to attend a graduate school for doctoral research eventually leading to a research&nbsp;career in photonics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">I have volunteered and participated in many national and international conferences and workshops. Also, the opportunity to attend conferences and courses&nbsp;allowed me with the chance to network with peers. I also take the chance to demonstrate the undergraduate physics at every opportunity, as I enjoy passing on&nbsp;the knowledge and techniques that I have gained to the younger, developing students. I am lively in various activities such as Optics to School, Open House,&nbsp;and various other educational and social outreach programs. I have also volunteered as a science communicator in &quot;science express&quot; which is a state of art&nbsp;science exhibition on train travelling across India.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">As if all of that weren&rsquo;t enough, I play cricket, football, table tennis, badminton etc. When I joined the university, I also joined the university cricket&nbsp;club out of my love for the game and soon became a very keen player for the team. I played for two seasons and have had some glorious wins. I also have the&nbsp;hobby of reading novels, magazines. My leisure pursuit is travelling and I have travelled to quite a no: of places in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka,&nbsp;Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Goa etc.</p>
