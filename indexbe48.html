<h3><img src="content/gt/45d225da49e226f7ea59e93b3b1bec37.png" alt="THE CENTRE" title="THE CENTRE" width="149" height="33" border="0" /></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) is one of the few institutions in India that have facilities for R&amp;D activities and manpower training in Photonics and related fields. In recognition of the outstanding work carried out by a group of teachers and researchers in photonics and related subjects, the University Grants Commission (UGC) identified CUSAT as a &quot;University with Potential for Excellence in Lasers and Optoelectronic Sciences&quot; in March 2002. Following this selection by University Grants Commission, CUSAT established a separate and independent &quot;Centre of Excellence in Lasers &amp; Optoelectronic Sciences&quot; (CELOS) in the month of July 2002. The activities under the CELOS have been jointly proposed by the International School of Photonics (ISP), Department of Physics and Department of Electronics in CUSAT. Based on the recommendations of the experts, UGC has made a budgetary allocation of Rs. 35.456 million towards the R &amp; D activities at the above Centre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img height="375" width="500" align="middle" class="picture" alt="CELOS Lab" src="picture/upload/image/General/Laser%20Lab.jpg" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As approved by the Expert Committee of the UGC, CELOS has established a National Facility centered around &ldquo;Tsunami&rdquo; a Spectra Physics make Ti:Sapphire pico/subpicosecond laser system with an amplifier. &quot;Tsunami&quot; is pumped by 5W &ldquo;Millenium&rdquo; diode pumped solid state laser. The output from the &quot;Tsunami&quot; seed laser is further amplified by &quot;Spitfire&quot; a chirped pulse amplifer which is pumped by &quot;Empower&quot; a 30W Q-switched DPSS Nd:YLF laser. The final amplified ultrashort pulses have 70 femtosecond pulse duration and an energy of ~ 2.5mJ per pulse at 1KHz repitition rate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
Research activities have been initiated by CELOS in the fields of Optical Fiber Amplifier, Fiber Optic Sensors, Photonic Materials, Microwave Photonics, Laser produced Plasma, Nonlinear Processes, Biophotonics and related fields. At present CELOS has two Research Associates, two Senior Research Fellows and four Junior Research Fellows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "></p>

<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<br />
Another major activity of CELOS is the conduct of the five year integrated M.Sc degree course in Photonics. UGC has set apart an amount of Rs. 19.4 million specifically for this purpose out of the total grant of Rs. 50 million. Six batches of 20 students each have so far joined the course. The first batch completed the course and passed out from the Centre in July 2007.<br />
