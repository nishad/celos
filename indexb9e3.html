<h3><img src="content/gt/af83756731642beffe0a28ef3cd0f2a1.png" alt="PHOTONIC MATERIALS" title="PHOTONIC MATERIALS" width="282" height="33" border="0" /></h3>
<div align="justify">As the world demands more computers and communication we turn increasingly to optical devices whose bandwidth and speed of execution offer great potential. However materials science has lagged behind in this rush into the optical domain. Optical properties of materials are not always well-matched to the functions we seek. This is in contrast to the vast range of electronic properties available to us. In the electronic domain we can almost make materials to order. The main cause of this richness in electronic properties is the interaction of electrons with the periodic structure of the materials. It is this interaction that decides whether a material will be a metal, a semiconductor, or an insulator, and can be further exploited to fine-tune the detailed electronic properties. Change the structure change the properties.<br />
<br />
<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="235" border="1" align="left" alt="Bragg scattering for X-rays" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/bragg_scattering.jpg" />It was this concept that led Yablonovitch to propose that we try the same trick with light. Interaction of electromagnetic waves with periodic structures goes back to Bragg and his observation that planes of atoms can act like perfect mirrors to X-rays when the Bragg condition is met:<br />
<br />
l  = 2dsin(q  &plusmn;  d ).<br />
<br />
In fact the perfect mirror behaviour holds over a range of angles, &plusmn; d , determined by how strongly the atoms scatter the X-rays. Any given arrangement of atoms will contain many possible Bragg planes reflecting X-rays from different directions. As a crystal is turned in a beam of X-rays it will briefly &lsquo;glint&rsquo; as each Bragg condition is met. Figure above illustrates the point.<br />
<br />
<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="211" border="2" align="right" alt="An electron micrograph of precious opal comprising sub-micron-sized silica spheres arranged in a face-centred cubic close-packed structure" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/opal_micrograph.jpg" />Thus we know that a crystal rejects X-rays for certain limited angles of incidence. The concept of Bragg reflection applies equally well to visible radiation except that we cannot rely on atoms to do the work for us. The material must have some periodic structure on the scale of the wavelength of light &ndash; a fraction of a micron. In fact, nature has made this arrangement for us in the case of gemstone opal. Some years ago, using an electron microscope it was shown that the brilliant colours observed in precious opal were due to mesoscale structure within the mineral. The structure had eluded previous workers because the scale was too fine to be seen <img width="223" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="153" border="1" align="left" alt="Peacock Butterfly" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/peacock_butterfly.jpg" />with optical instruments, and too coarse to be observed by X-rays. However, it is now possible to make beautiful electron micrographs that reveal the face-centred cubic close-packed arrangement of the microscopic silica spheres that constitute opal. Figure above shows such a micrograph.<br />
<br />
Nearly all of biology is &lsquo;engineered&rsquo; on the micron scale and with the help of DNA very complex structures are manufactured. Not surprisingly the optical properties are frequently exploited, nowhere with more spectacular effect than in <img width="210" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="221" border="2" align="right" alt="Scales of Adonis Blue butterfly" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/adonis_blue.jpg" />the butterfly. Many species show iridescent green or blue patches and these owe their colouring to diffraction from periodic materials in the scales of the wing. Figure above shows a photograph of a Peacock (Inachis Io) butterfly where the &lsquo;eyes&rsquo; exhibit the characteristic blue metallic sheen of a photonic material. Figure on right side shows a somewhat enlarged section of an almost entirely blue butterfly, the Adonis Blue, in which the tiny sub-millimetric scales are visible. Below is an electron micrograph of a scale taken from the butterfly Mitoura grynea, the entity responsible for the colour. Diffraction from a three-dimensional array of holes in the scale gives rise to its characteristic colour. Man has not yet completely mastered the art of manufacturing three-dimensional optical structures which nature produces with such ease.<br />
<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><img width="450" height="333" border="2" align="middle" alt="Electron micrograph of a broken scale taken from the butterfly Mitoura grynea " src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/scale.jpg" /></div>
<br />
<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="244" border="1" align="right" alt="Bragg scattering for a photonic material" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/bragg_scattering_pm.jpg" />So, just like electrons, photons can be pushed around by the structure of a material. Yablonovitch wanted to find out if just as a semiconductor has a forbidden band of energies within which no electron could enter the crystal, is it possible to make a periodic dielectric such that in a forbidden range of frequencies no photon could enter the crystal. What we need to do is find a periodic material in which the scattering of light is so strong that the rejection windows of the different Bragg planes overlap. When this happens photons will be rejected whatever direction they attempt to penetrate the material. In fact, such a material could truly be called a &lsquo;photonic insulator&rsquo;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img width="250" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="266" border="1" align="left" alt="Yablonovite" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/yablonovite.jpg" />Although the concept is a simple one, realizing a material structured on a sub-micron scale in three-dimensions s a highly non-trivial exercise. In opals, nature does the work for us by close packing spheres. Unfortunately this material, although beautiful, falls short of perfection &ndash; it is not a photonic insulator. The dielectric contrast between silica and air is too small, and the structure consisting of close-packed spheres is not sufficiently favourable. However Yablonovitch has shown that there is a structure manufactured by drilling holes that does behave as a photonic insulator. This structure has been christened &lsquo;Yablonovite&rsquo; in honour of its inventor, and its construction is given in figure.<br />
