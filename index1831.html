<div align="justify"><img width="288" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="75" align="right" alt="" src="picture/upload/image/activities/scope.jpg" />CELOS is an institution with national outreach&nbsp; where students from as many as 10 different states are studying. These students with them bring their own customs and traditions. SCOPE (Students' Club Of Photonics Education) was formed in January 2004 as an initiative by the students of Centre of Excellence in Lasers and Optoelectronic Sciences, CUSAT, to organize their academic, recreational, social and cultural activities.<br />
<br />
The word SCOPE means 'Vision'. The vision of the club is to initiate and organize the extra-curricular activities of students that can complement their formal education. The goal is to organize academic as well as non-academic events that are relevant to the motto. SCOPE also organizes regular seminars on topics ranging from technology to different aspects of society by distinguished personalities to enhance the overall development of students.<br />
<br />
One of the major event oraganized by SCOPE is the <b>Voluntary Blood Donation Camp</b> on World Health Day ie. April 7, 2005. It was held at ISP premises in collaboration with the Indian Medical Association. The chapter members and various other students of the University donated their blood to the blood bank.<br />
<br />
Recently a socio-cultural program was organized by SCOPE on 31st September to celebrate Onam, the most important festival of Kerala.</div>
