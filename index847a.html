<h4>&nbsp;Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT)</h4>
<font face="tahoma" color="#2d75ae"><b><br /><img width="60" vspace="3" hspace="10" height="70" align="right" src="picture/upload/Image/spo_aboutus/cusat_emblem.html" alt="CUSAT Logo" />Located in the lush environment of Kerala, overlooking the port city of Cochin -the Queen of the Arabian sea, is this distinguished university, which is one of the outstanding centers of higher education and research in the country.<br /><br /></b></font><br />Originally known as University of Cochin, the University came into being in 1971 through an Act of the Legislature that was the result of a concerted campaign for quality postgraduate education in the State of Kerala.<br /><br />Reorganization of the University into Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) saw the fulfilment of the aspirations of the pioneers that spearheaded the movement for establishment of a science &amp; technology university in the State. The process of reorientation resulted in redefining the objectives as &quot;the promotion of graduate and post graduate studies and advanced research in applied science, technology, industry, commerce, management and social science&quot;.<br /><br />Cast in the mould of a federal University, distinctly different from other universities in the State, today CUSAT is a premier Science and Technology University of the country. While striving to live up to the expectations of the society, the University has made quantum leaps in its academic pursuits and has spread its win.<br /><br /><img width="293" vspace="3" hspace="10" height="182" align="right" alt="CUSAT" src="picture/upload/Image/spo_aboutus/cusatphoto.html" />The Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) is on the threshold of a major change in the context of its identification as a promising institution for upgradation to the level of Indian Institute of Technology. This document contains a road map to upgradation. This is essentially a three-pronged action plan intended to improve substantially the academic, administrative and infrastructure facilities of the present University. Because of its diversified academic curricula and extensive research background, CUSAT is well placed to undergo this transformation with a tremendous degree of smoothness.<br /><br /><br />
<h4>Centre of Excellence in Lasers &amp; Optoelectronic Sciences (CELOS)<br /></h4>
<br />CUSAT is one of the few institutions in India that have facilities for R&amp;D activities and manpower training in Photonics and related fields. In recognition of the outstanding work carried out by a group of teachers and researchers in photonics and related subjects, the University Grants Commission (UGC) identified CUSAT as a &quot;University with Potential for Excellence in Lasers and Optoelectronic Sciences&quot; in March 2002. Following this selection by University Grants Commission, Cochin University of Science and Technology established a separate and independent &quot;Centre of Excellence in Lasers &amp; Optoelectronic Sciences&quot; (CELOS) in the month of July 2002. The activities under the CELOS have been jointly proposed by the International School of Photonics (ISP), Department of Physics and Department of Electronics in CUSAT.<br /><br />The major objectives of CELOS are to strengthen and consolidate the teaching and research activities in the field of Lasers &amp; Optoelectronic Sciences and to build them to a level of competence comparable with international standards. UGC has made an allocation to the tune of Rs. 354.56 lakhs towards the R &amp; D activities at the Centre, based on the recommendation of the experts on 12th August, 2004.<br /><br />As approved by the Expert Committee of the UGC, CELOS has established a National Facility centered around &ldquo;Tsunami&rdquo; a Spectra Physics make Ti:Sapphire pico/subpicosecond laser system with an amplifier pumped by 5W &ldquo;Millenium&rdquo; diode pumped solid state laser.<br /><br />Research activities have been initiated by CELOS in the fields of Optical Fiber Amplifier, Fiber Optic Sensors, Photonic Materials, Microwave Photonics, Laser produced Plasma, Nonlinear Processes, Biophotonics and related fields. At present CELOS is having two Research Associates, two Senior Research Fellows and four Junior Research Fellows.<br /><br />Another salient activity of CELOS is the conduction of the five year integrated M.Sc. degree course in Photonics. UGC has set apart an amount of Rs. 194 lakhs specifically for this purpose out of a total grant of Rs. 500 lakhs. The number of seats available for this course is 20.<br /></div>
