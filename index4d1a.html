<div align="justify">Holography is the science of producing holograms; it is an advanced form of photography that allows an image to be recorded in three dimensions. The technique of holography can also be used to optically store, retrieve, and process information.<br />
<br />
Holography was invented in 1947 by Hungarian physicist Dennis Gabor (1900&ndash;1979), for which he received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1971. The discovery was an unexpected result (or serendipity as Dennis would say) of research into improving electron microscopes at the British Thomson-Houston Company in Rugby, England. The British Thomson-Houston company filed a patent on 1947-12-17 but the field did not really advance until the discovery of the laser in 1960.<br />
<br />
The first holograms which recorded 3D objects were made by Emmett Leith and Juris Upatnieks in Michigan, USA in 1963 and by Yuri Denisyuk in the Soviet Union.<br />
<br />
There are several types of holograms which can be made. The very first holograms were &quot;transmission holograms&quot;, which were viewed by shining laser light through them. A later refinement, the &quot;rainbow transmission&quot; hologram allowed viewing by white light and is commonly seen today on credit cards as a security feature and on product packaging. These versions of the rainbow transmission holograms are formed as surface relief patterns in a plastic film, and they incorporate a reflective aluminum coating which provides the light from &quot;behind&quot; to reconstruct their imagery. Another kind of common hologram (a Denisyuk hologram) is the true &quot;white-light reflection hologram&quot; which is made in such a way that the image is reconstructed naturally using light on the same side of the hologram as the viewer.<br />
<br />
One of the most promising recent advances in the short history of holography has been the mass production of low-cost solid-state lasers &mdash; typically used by the millions in DVD recorders and other applications, but sometimes also useful for holography. These cheap, compact, solid-state lasers can compete well with the large, expensive gas lasers previously required to make holograms, and are already helping to make holography much more accessible to low-budget researchers, artists, and dedicated hobbyists.<br />
<br />
The difference between holography and photography is best understood by considering what a black and white photograph actually is: it is a point-to-point recording of the intensity of light rays that make up an image. Each point on the photograph records just one thing, the intensity (i.e. the square of the amplitude of the electric field) of the light wave that illuminates that particular point. In the case of a colour photograph, slightly more information is recorded (in effect the image is recorded three times viewed through three different colour filters), which allows a limited reconstruction of the wavelength of the light, and thus its colour.<br />
<br />
However, the light which makes up a real scene is not only specified by its amplitude and wavelength, but also by its phase. In a photograph, the phase of the light from the original scene is lost. In a hologram, both the amplitude and the phase of the light (usually at one particular wavelength) are recorded. When reconstructed, the resulting light field is identical to that which emanated from the original scene, giving a perfect three-dimensional image (albeit, in most cases, a monochromatic one, though colour holograms are possible).<br />
<br />
To understand the working principle of a hologram, we shall describe the engraving of a very simple one: a thin hologram of a scene formed by a single reflecting point.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="content/gt/edaabc180c2a3b65a3e8f6f97ae5692c.png" alt="Hologram engraving" title="Hologram engraving" width="162" height="27" border="0" /><br />
<img width="335" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="251" border="1" align="right" alt="Hologram Engraving" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/Holo_rec.gif" /><br />
In the image at right, the scene is illuminated by light plane waves coming from the left. The unique point represented by the white circle reflects a small portion of these waves. Only the waves reflected to the right are drawn. As these spherical waves move away from the point, their amplitude adds to the plane waves coming from the left. Where the tops coincide with tops and the hollows with hollows there will be a maximum of amplitude. Symmetrically, when tops coincide with hollows, the amplitude will be a minimum. Note that there are places of the space where there is always a maximum of amplitude whereas in others there is always a minimum of amplitude.<br />
<br />
Let us put a photosensitive surface in the place indicated by the dotted line. The exposure will be maximal where the amplitude is maximal and minimal where the amplitude is minimal. After proper treatment the more exposed zones of the plaque will be more transparent to light, and the less exposed zones more opaque. In the image, dotted lines surround the zones that will become more opaque.<br />
<br />
Note that if the distance between the reflecting point and the plate changes just a quarter of a micrometer (about 10 millionths of an inch) the zones more exposed will be replaced by less exposed and vice versa and the hologram will be blurred and useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="content/gt/43bc272899976c88d916a53248e8b73e.png" alt="Observing the hologram" title="Observing the hologram" width="189" height="27" border="0" /><br />
<br />
<b><img width="335" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="251" border="1" align="right" alt="Hologram Observation" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/Holo_obs.gif" /></b>We illuminate the hologram with plane waves coming from the left. Light traverses the non-opaque &quot;holes&quot; in the plate and each &quot;hole&quot; creates a semispherical wave that propagates at the right of the plate. In the image at right, we have drawn only the interesting part of the tops of these waves. Note that the waves that leave the holes of the plate add to give spherical wave fronts similar to those produced by the light diffused by the reflecting point. An observer placed in the right-hand side of the hologram sees light that seems to come from a point placed where was situated the reflective point. This is because the hologram transmits the light that has the &ldquo;good&rdquo; phase at the &ldquo;good place&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="content/gt/4c675f7856323f33f3ccaa52a72e145a.png" alt="An extended object instead of a point" title="An extended object instead of a point" width="293" height="27" border="0" /><br />
<br />
In reality, the light reflected by a small zone of an object (the point of the preceding example) is too weak to create transparent and opaque zones in the photographic plate. It can only lightly brighten or darken zones of the hologram. This does not prevent the creation of the half-spherical wave fronts when the hologram is illuminated. The observer will just find that the point is not very brilliant. A second reflective point will add, during the recording, its own lighter and darker zones. These zones will add with the others created by the first point. When the hologram is illuminated, each set of zones creates a set of semispherical wave fronts, which will seem to leave the position where each point was. A point that was farther from the plate, will &quot;be seen&rdquo; farther. The hologram has recorded the three-dimensional information of the position of the points.<br />
<br />
An extended object behaves just as a lot of light reflecting points. Each specific zone of the object creates a set of dark and light zones, which adds on the plate. Each set of zones creates, when the reading the hologram, a set of half-spherical waves which seem to leave the &ldquo;good&rdquo; place of the space: we see the (virtual) image of the object.<br />
<br />
In practice, this type of thin hologram &ndash; and with normal illumination &ndash; is seldom used because the photosensitive emulsions are thicker than the wavelength. Moreover, right holograms give also real images (in the optical meaning of the word) inconvenient for the observation of the hologram.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="content/gt/ee6e4422ef2c22d42e43cad6cece2ac5.png" alt="Holographic recording process" title="Holographic recording process" width="242" height="27" border="0" /><br />
<br />
To produce a recording of the phase of the light wave at each point in an image, holography uses a reference beam which is combined with the light from the scene or object (the object beam). Optical interference between the reference beam and the object beam, due to the superposition of the light waves, produces a series of intensity fringes that can be recorded on standard photographic film. These fringes form a type of diffraction grating on the film, which is called the hologram or the interference pattern.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><img width="500" height="290" border="1" alt="Hologram Recording" src="picture/upload/image/research_areas/Holography-record.png" /><br />
<div align="justify"><br />
Once the film is processed, if illuminated once again with the reference beam, diffraction from the fringe pattern on the film reconstructs the original object beam in both intensity and phase (except for rainbow holograms where the depth information is encoded entirely in the zoneplate angle). Because both the phase and intensity are reproduced, the image appears three-dimensional; the viewer can move his or her viewpoint and see the image rotate exactly as the original object would.<br />
<br />
Because of the need for interference between the reference and object beams, holography typically uses a laser in production. The light from the laser is split into two beams, one forming the reference beam, and one illuminating the object to form the object beam. A laser is used because the coherence of the beams allows interference to take place, although early holograms were made before the invention of the laser, and used other (much less convenient) coherent light sources such as mercury-arc lamps.<br />
<br />
In simple holograms the coherence length of the beam determines the maximum depth the image can have. A laser will typically have a coherence length of several meters, ample for a deep hologram. Also certain pen laser pointers have been used to make small holograms. The size of these holograms is not restricted by the coherence length of the laser pointers (which can exceed 1 m), but by their low power of below 5 mW.<br />
